ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @PBo2025

I just created my account, so I'm unsure how it works.  
I live in France and my English isn't perfect at all.  

I have several passions, which are (in no particular order)
- aeromodeling (flying and building airplanes).
- electronics (design and production, I own several measuring devices).
- C# programming with the Visual Studio application (application for managing images from my oscilloscope, a voice program for teaching children to tell the time, etc.).
- 3D design and production with my Anet printer.

Some of these hobbies come together in the same project.  
I no longer work and I enjoy discovering/understanding, just for the sake of learning, without any specific goal or opportunity.  
In short, with all these hobbies, the days are sometimes too short.

Bye
